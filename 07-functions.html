      /* Rules for function names
        - Can not use special words: function.
        - Can not start with a number.
        - Can not use special characters except: $_
        - Use a ver or action.
        - The script element runs when the page is loaded.
        - If inside a function we have a return without anything specified it will result in
        undefined. Once we return, it is not gonna run anything after the return.
        - Generally it is best practice to keep variables inside a scope if we can. Instead of using global variables.

      Rules for paramter names
        - Can not use special words.
        - Can not start with a number.
        - Can not use special characters except: $ _

      Best practice is to use camelCase.

      A parameter only exists inside the function's scope. A function can have more than one parameter.

      NaN value means not a number.
